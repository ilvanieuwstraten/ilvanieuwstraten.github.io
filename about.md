### More Information

With a experimental and researching behaviour I am exploring the relationship between nature and technology. I am interested in how creativity can combine these two. 
We live in exit- ing times, We get further and further away of the simplicity and com- fort of ‘a natural life’. We try to not drown in the ever growing wave of technological developments. I believe that design will create the connection between standing still and drowning away.With a head in the sky, feeds on the ground and a strong perseverance heart I will not give less then everything I can offer to build on a better future.as designer in process I want to use my knowledge for a simple goal: making the world a little better.
