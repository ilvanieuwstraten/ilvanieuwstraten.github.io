# The beautiful simplicity 

I have always had a love for nature. I love to be surrounded by trees. Seeing the bloom and the decay, the endless cycle of a process that is part of existence. Plants have always fascinated me. It feels good to be close to be close to them.The poetic ability of plants , the creation of oxygen. They create life.The green species, nature as we know it as in forest and gardens. The one we experience and design and even keep in  our houses to stay closer to them. We have a  natural attraction to them, just because we are aware of them and of their good intensions. But there is a species we are less aware of. This creatures, barely seen by man. It seems like they live in a different world, though, they are a large part of the same ecosystem.Algae are the most minimal form of plants. Their small size, but their power to create balance on earth is something that is imposing. The phenomenon of blue lights in the waves of the sea. Mystical. Intriguing. A beautiful appearance we as humans are naturally attracted to. Something that I have never seen, because their existence is further away of our daily lives.Itâ€™s time to raise awareness in their existence. In the beauty they can bring and show the possibilities into incorporate them in our lives. I want to show them to the world.I want to show their pureness. Their power. Their beautiful simplicity.
