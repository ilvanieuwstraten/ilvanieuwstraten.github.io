# The Power of simplicity 

Algae are very diverse and found almost everywhere on the planet. [Algae Biomass Organisations](http://allaboutalgae.com/what-are-algae/) says that they play an important role in many ecosystems, including providing the foundation for the aquatic food chains supporting all fisheries in the oceans and inland, as well as producing about 70 percent of all the air we breathe.

We are meant to be together.
I imagine algae in our daily life. The benefits of having algae closer in our environment.
They purify the air. Algae and human are like yin and yang; circling around each other, creating each others life substance. In this process of consuming and producing oxygen and carbon dioxide we would balance each other. 
They benefit from the same temperature as we are. Our houses are the environment they need.
They like light, just like as. We both get energy from the sun. The human, as having a natural attraction to light, we need it to stay alive, to stay happy. A shared environment will includes the light we need.
They are beautiful.
