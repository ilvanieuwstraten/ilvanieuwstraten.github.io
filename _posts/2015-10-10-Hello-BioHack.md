When I saw this quote during one the DIY experiments at **The BioHack Academy** at the **Waag Society** I knew this was . 
### H3 "Well this way"

Its all about experienimenting. trying, trying again, discovering, trying and trying again. It's important to not be intimidated by the world of biological science. Society sketches a view on it like it's big, complicated, unapproachable and even dangerous. But getting introduced to this field, I discover it is not. 

### H3 [We Live in the century of Biology](http://www.volkskrant.nl/wetenschap/spoedcursus-wat-zijn-gemonics~a4164748/?hash=4c59b8386ebaac5a4689e3661ab3a6acbc2036ef)

I am hungry for knowledge. I am increadably curious to find out what there is possible in this growing and developing field.

I will go hands on and experiment to discover BioHacking!
